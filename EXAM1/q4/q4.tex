\section{Memory Leak}

Consider the following function:


\resetlinenumber[1]
\linenumbers
\begin{tt}
  \lstinputlisting{\basepath/q4/q4.c}
\end{tt}
\nolinenumbers


Suppose the executable program is named {\tt q4prog}.

We run the program with

\begin{verbatim}
	./q4prog ece 264 midterm1
\end{verbatim}

Answer the questions A - C.

\vspace{0.2in}

Hint: The output of the program will be

\begin{verbatim}
	ece
	264
	midterm1
\end{verbatim}

{\bf ANSWER A:} Fix the code at line 32 to properly release memory. Your answer should the expression that is the argument to {\tt free}.

{\bf ANSWER B:} If we do not release memory at line 32, how
many bytes of memory will be leaked?

{\bf ANSWER C:} If we do not release memory at line 29, but we
\emph{do} release the memory at line 32, how many bytes of memory will
be leaked?
