\section{Merge Sort} 

Consider the following program for  merge sort.

\resetlinenumber[1]
\linenumbers
\begin{tt}
  \lstinputlisting{\basepath/q2/q2.c}
\end{tt}
\nolinenumbers

The {\tt mergeSort} function is caleld three times
using arrays of sizes 2, 4, and 8.  This question asks
you how many times {\tt mergeSort} and {\tt merge} are called.

This is the program's output:

\begin{verbatim}
sortcount= <<ANSWER A>>, mergecount=<<ANSWER B>>
sortcount= XXX, mergecount=XXX
sortcount= <<ANSWER C>>, mergecount= <<ANSWER D>>
\end{verbatim}

What are the answers marked as {\tt A} - {\tt D}?
Do not worry about {\tt XXX}


This is {\tt <<ANSWER E>>}: 
If the input array is already sorted in the ascending order, will
the answer for {\tt C} change? Please answer {\bf YES}
if the answer for {\tt C} changes.
Please answer {\bf NO}
if the answer for {\tt C} does not chang.
